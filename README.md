# RestaurantMenu

You know youâ€™ll need to create classes within the web application to facilitate this behavior and represent the various components of the menu. After talking to the owner, you have these details:

The menu consists of several menu items
Each menu item has a price, description, and category (appetizer, main course, or dessert)
It should be possible to display whether a menu item is new or not
The app should know when the menu was last updated, so visitors can see that the restaurant is constantly changing and adding exciting new items
